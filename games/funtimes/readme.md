This is a batch file game I wrote in 2008 when I was in high school. The original game only works on Windows XP or higher.

SUMMARY
--
FUNTIMES is a text-adventure game where you assume the role of a teenager living the longest day ever. During this day you'll have to do many tasks to gain weet points. These weet points are a representation of how "weet" you are -- weetness being the ultimate measure of one's awesomeness. You get weet points by doing weet things like finding a girlfriend, posting on forums, helping people out, etc. -- just be awesome and the game will do the rest of the work.

The game would be rated PG-13 if it went through the MPAA, for mild swearing, some sexuality, petty crime, and drug use. Don't play the game at all if any of these things offend you.

EXECUTION
--
Simply run "FUNTIMES.bat" to start playing the game. It will only run normally in Windows XP or higher, though it may be possible to get it running otherwise if you're dedicated enough. Running it in a zip file or whatever is not okay.
