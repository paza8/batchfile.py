Here are a few things you can do in the game that I want to make sure you check out and test:

-getting a gun from Ammu-Nation
-fixing the slushie machine (yes, it is possible)
-unlocking an entire new area of the game
-firing a hadouken at a leprechaun
-doing drugs with your best friend
-having a girlfriend (regardless of sex)

These are just some of the major things you can do in the game right now. Try to figure out how to do them all in one playthrough. :)
